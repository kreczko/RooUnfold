Put notes on the changes to this package here (latest at the top).
If you make a tag, please document it here as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tim Adye         19-Aug-2008 V00-01-06
  o Copy updated setmax (just name and comments) and smear to RooUnfoldTest2D.

Tim Adye         14-Aug-2008 tja080814a
  o Fix inefficiency simulation in RooUnfoldTest. Now goes from 0.3 at low x
    to 1 at high x as before.

Fergus Wilson    14-Aug-2008 ffw140808a
  o Bayesian Systematc error calculation due to unfolding matrix 
    disabled while investigate normalisation.

Tim Adye          6-Aug-2008 tja080813b
  o Add missing include file to RooUnfoldTest.
  o Fix for onepage==3.

Tim Adye          6-Aug-2008 tja080813a
  o Removed $ROOTSYS fallback in Makefile. That wouldn't work because
    $ROOTSYS/test/Makefile.arch would have already exited.

Fergus Wilson    13-Aug-2008 ffw130808c
  o Improved version of the Bayesian systematc error calculation.
  o Bayesian Systematic error calculation no longer done during
    training/testing.

Fergus Wilson    13-Aug-2008 ffw130808b
  o Remember to remove debug code.

Fergus Wilson    13-Aug-2008 ffw130808a
  o speeded up Bayesian covariance matrix at least factor two.

Fergus Wilson    13-Aug-2008 ffw130808
  o Changed smear method so it now works for different x-axis ranges.
    Efficiency correctly goes from 1.0 at low x to 0.3 at high x; shift is
    10% of the range; smearing is now 1 bin width.
  o RooUnfoldTest: change colors and markers to use names rather than numbers.
    Added a pulls histogram; Draw a line at y=0 on residual plot; added simple
    checking of some command line parameters.
  o RooUnfoldTestPdf: added a new distribution of exponential decaying
    background and a resonance (i.e. Higgs-like).
  o RooUnfoldBayesImpl: added a chi^2 method. Added 1-D smoothing. Speeded
    up covarinace matrix.

Tim Adye          6-Aug-2008 tja080806a
  o Get include directory from root-config --incdir as suggested by
    Peter Waller <peter.waller@gmail.com>.
  o More robust GNUmakefile. If $ROOTSYS/test/Makefile.arch doesn't exist, it
    gets settings from root-config. If that doesn't exist, it assumes everything
    is below $ROOTSYS in the standard places. These fallbacks probably won't
    work on anything except Linux.
  o Use -lRooFitCore if available (seems to be needed with ROOT 5.18 Cygwin).
  o Use make ROOTBUILD=debug for debug build.
  o Use make commands to see compiler options to be used.

Tim Adye         23-Jan-2008 V00-01-05
  o Include missing headers for ROOT 5.16/00.
  o Fix RooUnfoldTest2D.ps file name.
  o Rename RooUnfoldSvd's tau parameter to kterm to match Hoecker and
    Kartvelishvili's usage (they use k for the last term used in the expansion).

Tim Adye          2-Aug-2007 V00-01-04
Kerstin Tackmann 28-Jul-2007 kt072807
  RooUnfHistoSvd improvements:
  o Replace use of copy constructors by use of Clone. This should get rid of the
    segfaults that Jochen has been seeing.
  o Fixed bug in TUnfHisto::GetCov that could lead to small numerical changes in
    the estimated uncertainties.
  o Tested on my spectrum that the changes, which were supposed to be only
    clean-up between the previous two tags (Tim's and mine), do indeed give
    identical results on the curvature of the weight distributions and the
    errors.

Tim Adye          5-Apr-2007 V00-01-03
  o Fixes to build on Solaris.

Tim Adye          5-Apr-2007 V00-01-02
  o By default, build test programs with static RooUnfold library,
    so don't need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
  o Only link programs that need RooFit against RooFit.
  o Default NOROOFIT=1 if RooFit is not available.
  o Move README examples to the web page.

Tim Adye          4-Apr-2007 V00-01-01
  o Combine RooUnfHistoSvd and RooUnfold into a single stand-alone package.
  o Rewritten standalone GNUMakefile.
  o Combined History entries below.

Tim Adye         14-Nov-2006 tja061114a
  o Use TVectorDfwd.h in ROOT5

Kerstin Tackmann 15-Aug-2006 kt071506
  o RooUnfHistoSvd: Clean up of code, mostly in the form of getting rid of the
    many many couts and the GetBias methods, which where not working the way we
    wanted (technically they were, but they did not turn out useful to estimate
    the bias).

Tim Adye          9-Aug-2006 tja060809a
  o Allow zero regularisation parameter in RooUnfoldTest.cc.
  o Simpler pad selection in 2-up display RooUnfoldTest.cc.

Tim Adye         15-Dec-2005 tja051215a
  o Fix some typos in comments
  o Add reference to pre-built ROOT docs to README

Tim Adye         12-Dec-2005 V00-00-03
  o Add RooUnfoldExample.cc.
  o Use Int_t consistently in test routines.
  o Tidy up README.

Tim Adye         12-Dec-2005 V00-00-01
  o First RooUnfold version with Bayes, SVD, and bin-by-bin methods.

Tim Adye         12-Dec-2005 tja051212a
  o Initialise all RooUnfHistoSvd member variables on object creation.
  o Allow TUnfHisto::init caller to disable creation of results file.
  o Add GNUmakefile to allow also building outside BaBar environment.

Kerstin Tackmann 22-Nov-2005 kt221105
  o RooUnfHistoSvd: fixed the tau==25 problem

Tim Adye         18-Nov-2005 tja051118a
  RooUnfHistoSvd tweaks:
  o Declare method parameters "const" where appropriate.
  o Declare methods const or static where appropriate.
  o Pass vectors and matrices by const reference, rather than by value.
  o Don't forget to delete a few new'ed objects.

Kerstin Tackmann 30-Sep-2005 kt093005
  RooUnfHistoSvd improvements:
  o Much better use of memory
  o Fixed bug in GetBias
  o Commented the GetBias methods out to make sure people are aware that they
    should be more carefully tested on specific spectra than the general
    unfolding...

Kerstin Tackmann 15-Dec-2004 KT121504
  o RooUnfHistoSvd: Initial commit of current code
